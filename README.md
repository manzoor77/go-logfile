# go-logfile
### create logfile in go

Run the command **go run main.go** to compile and execute the program.
Open a web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:8080**
You should see the message "Hello, World!" in the browser, and a log file called "api.log" should be created in the same directory as main.go.

Here's an **example** of what the console output should look like:

> 2023/04/10 15:42:17 Starting server on port 8080
> 2023/04/10 15:42:24 Request from 127.0.0.1:50586 for /
> 2023/04/10 15:42:27 Request from 127.0.0.1:50586 for /favicon.ico
